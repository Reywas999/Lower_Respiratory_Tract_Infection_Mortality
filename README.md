### Methods
Lexis expansion used to create primary exposure and current age variables.\
Crude Mantel–Haenszel rate ratios, 95% C.I., and chi-squared p-values were calculated 
for each stratum of every exposure variable to mortality. Estimates of association were also 
calculated for each independent variable and the primary exposure to assess for potentially 
confounding variables. Spearman’s test of association was conducted to assess multicollinearity. 
LRTi association to mortality was then individually adjusted by each independent variable by stratum 
of LRTi using no contraction of a LRTi as baseline. \
A Poisson model was created as the intent of the study was to measure the association between predetermined 
time exposure groups and mortality by using the number of mortality occurrences. Each variable was individually 
tested for model fit against a model with just LRTi categories using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). Effect modification 
(EM) was similarly tested, with LRTs comparing models with and without an interaction term between LRTi categories and 
each variable individually. Departure of linear trend for non-binary variables was tested after adjusting for confounding 
variables.\
Any variables that did not act as confounding or effect modifying were dropped from the final models. Two final models 
were created. Both adjusted for confounding, but each had a different effect modifier. Stratified Hazard Ratios (HR), 
95% c.i., and p-value estimates are reported via linear combinations of parameters (lincom) for each model separately.\

### Conclusions
After adjusting for confounding, there is a 3.7 (c.i. 2.3 to 5.7, p < 0.001) times chance of mortality for care home 
residents aged over 75 years at <= 3 months from contracting a LRTi. Gender and influenza vaccination acceptance act 
as effect modifiers. There was an observed departure of linear trend for LRTi, and this is consistent with the findings 
that <= 3 months from LRTi there is a significant increased risk of mortality, but no such risk increase for > 3 months 
from LRTi. \
There is a significant increase in mortality for those that accepted the vaccination and did not contract a LRTi (Table 3). 
However, amongst individuals that rejected the vaccine, those that contracted a LRTi were 6.9 (c.i. 4.0 to 11.8, p < 0.001) 
times as likely to die at <= 3 months from contraction. In comparison, amongst individuals that accepted the vaccine, those 
that contracted a LRTi were 1.9 (c.i. 0.8 to 4.6, p = 0.16) times as likely to die at <= 3 months from contraction. This is 
equivalent to a 3.6 increased chance of mortality in vaccine rejecting individuals at <= 3 months from LRTi contraction. 
This suggests that vaccination confers protection for individuals that contract a LRTi, but increases risk for those that do not. 
Participants that accepted the vaccine and contracted a LRTi were significantly less likely die at > 3 months from contraction 
than individuals that accepted the vaccine and did not contract a LRTi (Table 3). \
Males are at increased risk (Table 3) of mortality at <= 3 months from LRTi contraction. The significant (p = 0.002) discrepancy 
in vaccine acceptance amongst the genders, with males being much less likely to accept vaccination, may be a contributing factor 
to this effect.
